HarmoGen: A Four-part Harmony Generator

Please see doc/HarmoGen.pdf for the publication associated with this project.

Eclipse .classpath and .project files are included for your convenience.  The App UI can be easily run from eclipse.

Unfortunately, there's no buildfile as of now, as this was originally (long time ago!) an academic project.
